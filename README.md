#instructions
firstly u have to install pytube by entering following commands in vs code or pycharm:
pip install pytube
                   or
You can download pytube from official libraries of python.
After that just run the code and Enjoy it!

In this python file u can just copy youtube links and paste it in the dialog box.
after that it will take some time and sometimes it may shows not responding dialogue but don't worry it will download your videos.



Thanks
